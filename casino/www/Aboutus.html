            <h1>Gambling Legislation</h1>
            <p>
                At Gambling.com we don’t just report on legislation changes across the various countries where online gambling is evolving,
                
       
                

                we strive to be part of that evolving process. Our industry reputation and longevity, 
                combined with expertise and years of experience allows us to set the bar high, contribute to working papers, 
                industry conferences and the general education of governing bodies.
        


                We established the first ever American Gambling Awards which recognised key legislators, 
                encouraged debate and good practice and welcomed a whole new legal industry into America in 2019. 
                We have been part and remain committed to taking part in global seminars where those not usually immersed in the online gambling word can gain knowledge, 
                drive change and establish good practice that benefits consumers and operators alike.


                Offshore markets do exist, 
                gambling does take place in countries and jurisdictions where it is not legal and at Gambling.com we do not promote, 
                engage or operate within these areas and never will. We strive to educate, eradicate and highlight those operations that do rather than ignore it.
